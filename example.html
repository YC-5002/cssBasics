    <!--It took me around 10 minutes to complete task 2. It was rather simple since
    we formatted boxes previously in the same way, specifically the background color,
    the height and weight of the div. What needed more searches was the box-shadow 
    and the border radius which I previously used to complete the extra credit in the
